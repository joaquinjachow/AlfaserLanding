        "In 1959, Carlos Walter Oechsle turned his passion for motorcycles into a dream come true: opening a small spare parts shop in Córdoba. In the early years, he personally delivered products by bicycle, fostering a closeness and personal touch that became the DNA of the company.",
        "With effort, dedication, and a customer-centric approach, Oechsle grew and added internationally renowned brands such as FRAM, Castrol, and Molykote. Today, we have a catalog of over 16,000 items, an infrastructure of more than 4,000 m², and reach more than 2,500 clients across the country.",
        "Our team of 85 collaborators keeps the spirit of our founder alive: trust, closeness, and a vocation for service. Currently, the second and third generations of the Oechsle family work in the company, ensuring the continuity of its values and vision.",
        "Oechsle is part of Grupo OSAC along with Sarico, Alfaser, and Codeflex, continuing the family tradition with the same passion as in the beginning and always looking to the future."
